# CapstoneOne
Springboard Guided Capstone project. 

Here we take a look at data from national ski resorts and attempt to dertimine how we can can answer this question:

> How can Big Mountain Resort maintain the business's profit margin at 9.2% or higher by offsetting the newly incurred operational costs of $1.54M with an adjustment of ticket prices, operational costs, and revenue generation this year?

During the study I worked through a guided version of the Data Science Method with Springboard's curriculum. My biggest challenge was attempting to find any meanigful data about Big Mountain Resort because that patiicular ski resort was missing from the dataset. So I approached the entire study by using national averages to make assumptions on how Big Mountain Resort could improve retain a their profit margin.

Ultimetly I found that resorts with more chairs and more runs can justify raising chair lift ticket prices. All report information can be found in the "reports" directory.
